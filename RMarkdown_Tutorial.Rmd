##The Preamble

- This is where you specify things **about** your document, such as author, general format, or font color. 
- For now, the defaults will suffice. But, if you're interested, find more options [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html) or [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#yaml-metadata-block)

Here's an example: 

```{r preamble, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
---
title:  'This is the title: \n it contains a colon and new line'
subtitle: 'This is a really short subtitle'
author:
- Author One
- Author Two
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B %Y')`"
tags: [nothing, nothingness]
abstract: |
  This is the abstract.

  It consists of two paragraphs.
output: 
    pdf_document:
        template: NULL
---
```

## Text and Formatting

**Show them the markdown help!

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

- Run a chunk using ""

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
